# Pythagoras Tree Visualizer

This is a visualizer for a program I wrote in C++ a while back. It generates a Pythagoras Tree based on user specified values for the angle and depth level. Shortly after uploading the original C program, I realized that it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever download the project to run it, and simply reading the code is boring. So, I decided to rewrite it as a web app to increase the project's accessibility for anyone who might want to try it out, as well as to improve my web development skills. 

Enjoy!
